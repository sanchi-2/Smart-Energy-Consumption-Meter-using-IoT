The aim of this project “Smart Energy Consumption Meter using IoT” is to design and develop a real-time energy monitoring system that
measures important electrical parameters such as voltage, current, power factor, real power, and total energy consumption (kWh) using IoT technology. 
The system focuses on providing users with accurate and continuous energy usage data on a cloud-based platform (Blynk), enabling remote monitoring, 
awareness of consumption behaviour, and encouraging efficient and responsible use of electricity.
